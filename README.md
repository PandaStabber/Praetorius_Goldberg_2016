# Installation instructions

This installation is for Mac OSX. Instructions are not given for a virutal environment, but it should work.


## Obtaining python3
The model is programmed in python3. If you don't have 3, please follow the following instructions.

1. Install homebrew.
Paste the following into a terminal prompt.

`'/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Update homebrew by pasting the following into a terminal prompt.

`brew update`

2. Use homebrew to install python3.
Paste the following into a terminal prompt:

`brew install python3`

## Installing git
Git is a great way to make code development easier. It's powerful, but the basics are super simple. To make things easy,

## Obtaining the script
I do have aspirations of making this a deployable package, but for now I think it's best to keep it simple. The easiest method would be to download the file directory using the button above. This will download the all the files into a seperate folder. It should be able to be run without problem from this folder.

The preferred method is to use git to fork the directory to your github account so you can continue development. To do this, press the 'fork' button. Once you've forked the model to your personal github account, use git to download the model.

Once forked, find the clone github address, copy it, and paste it into a terminal prompt. I've included what this would look like from this dirtory:

`git clone https://github.com/eli-s-goldberg/Praetorius_Goldberg_2016.git`
